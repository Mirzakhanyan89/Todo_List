# Todo_List

Implement a program that will enable the user to create, delete, modify tasks. 
The user can also mark the task as completed, as a result of which the task does not disappear from the list, 
but the text is displayed in a different way (for example, the word [completed] can be added next to it). 
For the Todo List, it is also necessary to show the number of completed and uncompleted tasks.
    After completing this, add an option to specify/select a deadline for each task added. In other words,
in addition to the text, the task will also contain the date by which it should be completed. 
If the date is one day away, but the task has not yet been marked as completed, 
then the text of the task should be displayed in a different way. 
If the task deadline is less than an hour away, your website should somehow display a message 
to the user that the task deadline is approaching.
